## Retrieve Data 

```python
import requests
import markdown

def retrieve_data():
    # Retrieve data from the database or API
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/ai-professionals')
    data = response.json()
    return data

def generate_markdown_table(data):
    # Generate the markdown table
    table = "| Name | Affiliation | Contact Details |\n"
    table += "| --- | --- | --- |\n"
    
    for entry in data:
        name = entry['name']
        affiliation = entry['affiliation']
        contact_details = entry['contact_details']
        table += f"| {name} | {affiliation} | {contact_details} |\n"
    
    return table

def main():
    # Retrieve data
    data = retrieve_data()
    
    # Generate markdown table
    table = generate_markdown_table(data)
    
    # Display the formatted markdown table
    print(markdown.markdown(table))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Please note that this code assumes that the data is retrieved from an API and is in JSON format. You may need to modify the `retrieve_data` function to suit your specific database or API implementation. Additionally, you may need to install the `requests` library if it is not already installed.

## Apps

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, PasswordField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, Email, Length

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'

class RegistrationForm(FlaskForm):
    username = StringField('Username', validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=4, max=20)])
    email = StringField('Email', validators=[DataRequired(), Email()])
    password = PasswordField('Password', validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=8)])
    submit = SubmitField('Sign Up')

@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    form = RegistrationForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        # Process registration logic here
        return 'Registration successful!'
    return render_template('register.html', form=form)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In the above code, we have implemented a web application using the Flask framework. The application includes a registration form with fields for username, email, and password. The form uses validators to ensure the required data is provided and meets certain criteria (e.g., minimum length for username and password, valid email format).

When the form is submitted, it triggers the `register()` function. Inside this function, you can add the logic to process the registration, such as storing the user's information in a database.

To run the application, save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and execute it using a Python interpreter. The Flask development server will start, and you can access the registration form by visiting `http://localhost:5000/register` in your web browser.
